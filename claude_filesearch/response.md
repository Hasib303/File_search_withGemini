# Food Truck Commissary Plan Set Review

## Project Overview
- **Project:** Food Truck Commissary Kitchen
- **Location:** 959 Sebastopol Road, Santa Rosa, CA 95407
- **Owner:** Santa Rosa Vehicle Storage LLC
- **Architect:** Schwartz Architecture
- **MEP Engineer:** Warner Mechanical Engineering
- **Date:** October 10, 2025
- **Project Scope:** Interior improvements to convert existing building to food truck commissary with cold storage, dry storage, and food preparation areas

## Key Issues Identified

### Critical Issues
1. **Future date on drawings** - Issue date shows 10/10/2025, which is in the future (should be corrected)
2. **Incomplete structural information** - Seismic design data reference on G01 states "SEE SHEET XXXX" - structural sheets appear to be missing
3. **No fire sprinkler system** - Building indicates "NO" for fire sprinklers despite occupancy change and food service use
4. **Deferred/Separate submittals listed as N/A** - May need clarification on what items are truly not applicable
5. **Special inspections statement shows N/A** - Food service facilities typically require health department inspections

### Code Compliance Concerns
1. **Occupancy separation** - B to U occupancy requires 2-hour separation without sprinklers (noted correctly)
2. **Grease interceptor sizing** - Shown on plans but calculations not provided
3. **Ventilation rates** - Kitchen shows 93 CFM minimum, relatively low for commercial kitchen
4. **Accessibility path of travel** - Multiple existing buildings on site; coordination needed
5. **Fire extinguisher locations** - Noted as "COORD LOCATION PER FIRE MARSHAL" - needs resolution before permit

### Design Coordination Issues
1. **Structural drawings missing** - Referenced but not included in set
2. **Civil drawings referenced** - Not included in architectural set
3. **Fire protection noted as "NIC" (Not in Contract)** - Unclear who provides
4. **Existing conditions verification** - Multiple notes to "V.I.F." (Verify in Field)
5. **Sheet A1 reference on cover sheet** - Should be A41 per actual sheet list
