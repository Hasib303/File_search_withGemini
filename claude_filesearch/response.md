# Code Compliance Review - Food Truck Commissary

## Project Information
- **Project**: Food Truck Commissary at Santa Rosa Vehicle Storage LLC
- **Location**: 959 Sebastopol Road, Santa Rosa, CA 95407
- **Occupancy**: B (Business) with S-1 (Storage) components
- **Construction Type**: Type V-B
- **Issue Date**: 10/10/2025

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Critical Date Issue**
- **Issue**: The issue date listed is **10/10/2025**, which is in the future (as of current review).
- **Code Reference**: This appears to be a typographical error. Construction documents should reflect accurate dates.
- **Recommendation**: Correct the issue date to reflect the actual submission date.

---

### 2. **Conflicting Occupancy Information**
- **Issue**: The cover sheet (G01) indicates multiple occupancy groups including B, F-1, and S-1, with mixed occupancy classification. However, the specific classification and separation requirements are not clearly detailed.
- **Code Reference**: CBC 508 (Mixed Occupancy)
- **Recommendation**: Clarify whether accessory occupancies (CBC 508.2), nonseparated (508.3), or separated (508.4) occupancy rules apply. The code compliance plan should clearly show separation details.

---

### 3. **Fire Sprinkler System Discrepancy**
- **Issue**: Sheet G01 states "FIRE SPRINKLERS: NO" for the existing building, but this is a commercial kitchen facility with food preparation, which typically requires automatic fire suppression.
- **Code Reference**: 
  - CBC 903.2 (Automatic Sprinkler Systems)
  - CFC 904.2 (Commercial Cooking Systems)
- **Recommendation**: Verify if the facility requires automatic sprinklers based on occupancy load, area, and use. Commercial kitchen hoods typically require Type I hood systems with suppression.

---

### 4. **Commercial Kitchen Ventilation**
- **Issue**: The drawings show ventilation equipment (SF-1, CEF-2) but do not clearly indicate if the kitchen exhaust hood is a **Type I** or **Type II** hood system.
- **Code Reference**: 
  - CMC 507 (Commercial Kitchen Hoods)
  - IMC 507.2.1 (Type I hoods required for grease-producing appliances)
- **Recommendation**: Specify hood type and confirm compliance with commercial kitchen exhaust requirements, including fire suppression if Type I hood is required.

---

### 5. **Plumbing Fixture Count**
- **Issue**: The plumbing fixture calculations show fixtures for B and S-1 occupancies, but the **grease interceptor** sizing and service sink requirements for the commissary kitchen are not clearly documented.
- **Code Reference**: 
  - CPC 1014 (Grease Interceptors)
  - CPC Table 4-1 (Minimum Plumbing Fixtures)
- **Recommendation**: Provide grease interceptor sizing calculations and confirm compliance with local requirements for food service facilities.

---

### 6. **Accessibility - Path of Travel**
- **Issue**: While accessible parking and toilet rooms are shown, the **primary function area** (commissary kitchen) is indicated as a new use. CBC 11B-202.4 requires that when alterations affect a primary function area, the path of travel must be upgraded.
- **Code Reference**: CBC 11B-202.4
- **Recommendation**: Verify that 20% of alteration costs are allocated to path of travel improvements (accessible route, restrooms, drinking fountains, etc.) unless disproportionate.

---

### 7. **Accessible Toilet Room Compliance**
- **Issue**: Toilet room details show accessibility features, but the commissary kitchen area (101) shows an occupant load of 2.5 (rounded to 3). It's unclear if separate employee facilities are required or if the existing toilet rooms adequately serve the new use.
- **Code Reference**: CBC 2902 (Minimum Number of Fixtures)
- **Recommendation**: Confirm fixture count meets minimum requirements for both the commissary kitchen employees and the overall building occupancy.

---

### 8. **Energy Compliance - Mechanical Ventilation**
- **Issue**: Energy compliance forms (G02-G04) show ventilation calculations, but the **demand control ventilation** (DCV) or **energy recovery** requirements for the commercial kitchen are not addressed.
- **Code Reference**: CEC 140.4(m) and 120.1 (Ventilation and Indoor Air Quality)
- **Recommendation**: Verify if the kitchen exhaust system requires makeup air with energy recovery or other energy-saving measures per Title 24 Part 6.

---

### 9. **Exit Signage and Emergency Lighting**
- **Issue**: The plans show exit routes and occupant loads, but **exit signs** and **emergency egress illumination** are not clearly indicated on the floor plans or reflected ceiling plans.
- **Code Reference**: 
  - CBC 1013 (Exit Signs)
  - CBC 1008 (Means of Egress Illumination)
- **Recommendation**: Add exit signage and emergency lighting to the plans, especially along the path of egress travel from the commissary kitchen.

---

### 10. **Fire Separation - B to S-1 Occupancy**
- **Issue**: The code compliance plan indicates a **2-hour fire separation required between B and U occupancies** without sprinklers, but details of the separation assembly are not provided.
- **Code Reference**: CBC Table 508.4
- **Recommendation**: Provide fire-rated assembly details and confirm proper penetration protection for all utilities crossing the separation.

---

### 11. **Trench Detail Reference**
- **Issue**: Sheet A99 references "Santa Rosa Standard Trench Details" but these appear to be civil/plumbing related. It's unclear if these apply to the current scope or are included for reference only.
- **Recommendation**: Clarify applicability and ensure trench details comply with current City of Santa Rosa standards.

---

### 12. **Water Heater Installation**
- **Issue**: The plumbing plans show a new 50-gallon gas water heater (WH-1) with T&P relief and seismic strapping details. However, **combustion air** and **venting** details are referenced to HVAC drawings (M2.1), but M2.1 does not provide specific flue vent sizing or termination details.
- **Code Reference**: 
  - CPC Chapter 5 (Water Heaters)
  - CMC Chapter 8 (Chimneys and Vents)
- **Recommendation**: Provide complete combustion air and venting details, including flue size, termination height, and clearances.

---

## Summary

The plans are generally comprehensive but require clarification and corrections in the following areas:

1. **Correct the issue date** (currently shows future date: 10/10/2025)
2. **Clarify fire sprinkler requirements** for the occupancy and use
3. **Specify Type I or Type II hood** for commercial kitchen
4. **Provide grease interceptor sizing** calculations
5. **Verify accessibility path of travel** compliance per CBC 11B-202.4
6. **Add exit signs and emergency lighting** to plans
7. **Detail fire-rated separations** between occupancies
8. **Complete water heater venting details** and combustion air requirements

**Recommendation**: Address these items prior to permit issuance to ensure full code compliance.%
